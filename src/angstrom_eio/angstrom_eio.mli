  val parse
    : ?pushback:(unit -> unit)
    -> 'a t
    -> #Eio.Flow.source
    -> (Buffered.unconsumed * ('a, string) result)

  val parse_many
    : 'a t
    -> ('a -> unit)
    -> #Eio.Flow.source
    -> (Buffered.unconsumed * (unit, string) result)

  (** Useful for resuming a {!parse} that returns unconsumed data. Construct a
      [Buffered.state] by using [Buffered.parse] and provide it into this
      function. This is essentially what {!parse_many} does, so consider using
      that if you don't require fine-grained control over how many times you want
      the parser to succeed.

      Usage example:

      {[
        match parse parser flow with
        | { buf; off; len }, Ok a ->
          let state = Buffered.parse parser in
          let state = Buffered.feed state (`Bigstring (Bigstringaf.sub ~off ~len buf)) in
          with_buffered_parse_state state flow
        | Error err -> failwith err
      ]} *)
  val with_buffered_parse_state
    : ?pushback:(unit -> unit)
    -> 'a Buffered.state
    -> #Eio.Flow.source
    -> (Buffered.unconsumed * ('a, string) result)
