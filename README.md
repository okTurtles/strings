# String Extractor

The String Extractor is a program that runs on your computer to help manage translations.

## Help translate a language
You can contribute by directly making changes to the `.strings` file for the language of your choice. Those files are located in the `strings/` directory. If the language of your choice is not present yet, follow the instructions in [Add a language](#Add-a-language).

Feel free to make edits directly on Github!

Example (`french.strings`):

**before**
```
/* MISSING TRANSLATION - frontend/views/pages/Home.vue */
"Logout" = "Logout";

/* MISSING TRANSLATION - frontend/views/containers/contributions/ContributionsWidget.vue */
"You and {count} other members are contributing." = "You and {count} other members are contributing.";
```

**after**
```
/* frontend/views/pages/Home.vue */
"Logout" = "DÃ©connexion";

/* frontend/views/containers/contributions/ContributionsWidget.vue */
"You and {count} other members are contributing." = "Vous, ainsi que {count} autres membres, contribuez.";
```
Notes:
- The original English text is on the left and must not be changed.
- Removing `MISSING TRANSLATION` is not necessary.
- Text is enclosed within double quotes.
- Do not modify text enclosed within `{` and `}`, but you can move it.
- To represent the double quote character itself (`"`), use `\"`.
- To represent the backslash character itself (`\`), use `\\`.

## Add a language

1. Make a copy of `english.strings` and rename it to e.g. `french.strings`
2. Start translating `french.strings`!
